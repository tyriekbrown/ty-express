My Awesome Project:


This project for for a deadline I had to meet, this requred to quickly put together code.


How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, Node, Mongo Framework of choice

This was simply built but the complexity made it a little challenging to put the code together. when you are on a time limit, simple doesn't really offer a hand so .........


Lessons Learned:
I had to get creative very quickly and think of a simple express project to pass in, so time management under pressure was a lesson learned, as well as quickly putting two seperate styles of coding together to get a desired result.
