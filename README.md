<h1>My Awesome Project:</h1>


This project for for a deadline I had to meet, this requred to quickly put together code.

<h1>How It's Made:</h1>
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, Node, Mongo Framework of choice

This was simply built but the complexity made it a little challenging to put the code together. when you are on a time limit, simple doesn't really offer a hand so .........


<h2><Lessons Learned:</h2>

I had to get creative very quickly and think of a simple express project to pass in, so time management under pressure was a lesson learned, as well as quickly putting two seperate styles of code i worked on together to get results.
